      "Back then I thought this was a big place\n"
      "But my ambition grew too big\n"
      "That big house became too small now\n"
      "When the nine trainees shared a 17-pyung house\n"
      "Seems like it was just yesterday, we grew up a lot\n"
      "Good things were always other people’s things\n"
      "We were always hoarse from an uncertain future and worries\n"
      "Seeing all the senior artists at the end of the year awards\n"
      "Let’s not forget those things but put them away\n"
      "This place smells like us\n"
      "Let’s not forget this scent, wherever we are\n"

      "Traces of being used like bank accounts and credit cards\n"
      "As much as the place was small, we were bound together tighter\n"
      "Fight right here, hitting each other sometimes\n"
      "Maybe that’s why but we have good feelings and bad feelings of love too\n"
      "Even the dust will be cleared now\n"
      "There’s more stuff than the beginning, I have more than when I started too\n"
      "Now let’s take our pride and go toward a bigger world with a bigger dream\n"

      "The machine in my mom’s heart and the big scar\n"
      "In winter of 2010 at Daegu\n"
      "The childish me used to measure the size of the world\n"
      "The reason why we moved into a business\n"
      "Was because of all the bad things people said, saying we follow the money\n"
      "So moving left many things with me\n"
      "Whether I liked it or not, it changed a lot in my life\n"
      "My life was about paying rent, I know\n"
      "I lived with my pride put into the down payment\n"
      "So I’m gonna move again\n"

      "[Rap Monster] You just wanted to say that didn't you?\n"
      "[Jin] That means that your voice didn't come out in ''I Need U''\n"

      "[Jimin] I felt good, though, to be honest when Suga-hyung didn't rap but everyone sang along anyway\n"
      "[Jin] Okay but imagine this\n"
      "[Rap Monster] There were so many people there as well and it just felt so good\n"
      "[Jin] We just opened our eyes but we're practicing for ''No More Dream'' in the training room, how would you feel?\n"
      "[Jimin] No, no, I'm not going back\n"

      "[V] With one song\n"
      "[Suga] Okay but seriously, this could all be a dream, like to be honest there were lots of artists that did well in Korea\n"
      "[Rap Monster] That's true\n"
      "[Suga] I always think you should do well with one song first then go further but I'm a little bit anxious because it's not like our title song has come out yet or anything\n"
      "[Rap Monster] That's true\n"
      "[Jin] Ah this kid has a talent in bringing down the mood\n"
      "[J-Hope] Suddenly... it's almost like the titanic\n"
      "[Jin] Yep\n"
      "[Rap Monster] Right before it sinks\n"
      "[Jin] It's been overthrown\n"
      "[J-Hope] Ah, Yoongi-hyung just happens to say something like this, really bursts the bubble\n"
      "[Jin] I know right\n"
      "[Jimin] 'The title hasn't even come out yet'\n"
      "[J-Hope] I know right, ''the title songs hasn't even... ''\n"
      "[V] No wait! Okay, so the title just has to come out well, right?\n"
      "[Jin] Yeah\n"
      "[V] Yeah then just like make it well, huh? Release it and boom it will be a hit again. So easy amirite?\n"
      "[All] Lol\n"
      "[Rap Monster] Hey you should just go to bed\n"
      "[Jin] Yeah, you suit being asleep better\n"
      "[Jimin] You usually don't say anything\n"
      "[Rap Monster] At this point I want to ask Hobi, say something about your expectations for our music this time round\n"
      "[Jin] Hobi, what do you think?\n"
      "[J-Hope] I think we'll do well\n"
      "[All] Lol\n"
      "[Rap Monster] Noo\n"

      "[Suga] Oh ya\n"
      "[Rap Monster] When we go to Korea! Bang-Pd-Nim will have prepared incredible tracks for us\n"
      "And us? We just have to add our talent on the top of it!\n"
      "[Jimin] Why are you being like this?\n"
      "[Jin] We can say no no to our worries\n"
      "[Rap Monster] Ah but worries\n"
      "[All] Hahahaha\n"
      "[Jin] Why why why\n"
      "[Rap Monster] Okay but the reason why I think we don't have to worry is that, even today we performed in front of 5000 people",

      "RM: I’m not saying we should boast, but to be honest it is a huge success. That’s what I think. But because of that, I keep wondering - To what point, how far we need to go up. Like we go really far up. For example, the video in front of us, won’t it be replayed forever? Like in 10 years, we'll go on reality shows and they’ll play that video and ask how we felt over and over again. After experiencing that, it makes me nervous honestly. It makes me wonder how far we might fall down.\n"
      "J-Hope: Ow... Yeah\n"
