      "I didn’t have any dreams\n"
      "Just like my lyrics, every day in that way\n"
      "The functions and equations that couldn’t give me an answer\n"
      "In the end those things became uncountable injuries\n"
      "It makes it impossible to see the stars hidden behind that light\n"
      "Day by day, I killed myself slowly like that\n"
      "Meaninglessly obsessing all day on being graded like cuts of beef\n"
      "I just wanted to succeed\n"
      "The words I tediously heard from others were only that\n"
      "I thought I could catch the mirage known as happiness\n"
      "But the me in front of my desk wasn’t happy even for a moment\n"
      "Without my mom knowing, I put a sheet of white paper between the pages of my workbook\n"
      "My identity that I wrote down matched to the drum and bass\n"
      "A different, relaxed feeling compared to when I got my report card\n"
      "Even when I was #1 my heart couldn’t relax\n"
      "Is there a need to want the things that others want\n"
      "Rather than living an entire life while sighing breaths full of *han*\n"
      "I chose to live a life of stripping away my *han* and breathing easily\n"
      "Everyone pointed at me, surrounding the weakened me\n"
      "My dreams are what gives my voice to everything\n"
      "No matter what appearance I have, with my mic and lyrics\n"
      "I don’t know how you’ll be while listening to this, but\n"
      "Even if you curse me, it’s good, because in the end you’ll find me again\n"
      "Yeah, even as 7 years passed, with a mic worth 50,000 won\n"
      "Still making my mixtape by myself in one corner of my room\n"
      "Some say I’m fake, okay, I admit it, my dark past\n"
      "I can justify it, but I won’t, so that kind of problem won’t happen again\n"
      "Yeah I be real\n"
      "In this moment the things that I want the most acutely\n"
      "The pedal that I stepped on for 7 years has finally been oiled\n"
      "You can’t kill, come take it if you do wanna piece of me\n"
      "Say it only with music, I don’t need any other field\n"

      "V: True\n"
      "RM: I’m not saying we should boast, but to be honest it is a huge success. That’s what I think. But because of that, I keep wondering - To what point, how far we need to go up. Like we go really far up. For example, the video in front of us, won’t it be replayed forever? Like in 10 years, we'll go on reality shows and they’ll play that video and ask how we felt over and over again. After experiencing that, it makes me nervous honestly. It makes me wonder how far we might fall down.\n"
      "J-Hope: Ow... Yeah\n"
      "Suga: Me too, me too. I relate so much because the hardest thing for me is that going up is going up. We worked hard to come up to where we are.\n"
